```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a list of data
data = [
    [1, "Alice", 25, 10000],
    [2, "Bob", 30, 20000],
    [3, "Carol", 28, 15000],
]

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["id", "name", "age", "salary"])

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

**Output:**

```
   id   name  age  salary
0   1  Alice   25   10000
1   2    Bob   30   20000
2   3  Carol   28   15000
```

The code is already correct, but here are some suggestions for improvement:

* Use more descriptive variable names. For example, instead of `data`, you could use `employees_data`.
* Add comments to explain what the code is doing. For example, you could add a comment above the `df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["id", "name", "age", "salary"])` line to explain that this code is creating a DataFrame from the `employees_data` list.
* Use a coding style guide to format your code consistently. For example, you could use the PEP 8 style guide.

Overall, the code is well-written and easy to understand. With the suggestions above, it could be even better.
