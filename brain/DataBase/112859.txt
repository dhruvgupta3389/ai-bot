(Verse 1)
Oh, eyes, windows to the soul,
You tell me stories untold.
In your depths, I lose my mind,
In your gaze, I find my kind.

(Chorus)
Eyes, eyes, so beautiful and bright,
You fill my world with light.
Eyes, eyes, so deep and true,
I'm lost in love with you.

(Verse 2)
Eyes, you sparkle like the stars,
You guide me through the darkest night.
You see the world in a different way,
And help me find my brighter day.

(Chorus)
Eyes, eyes, so beautiful and bright,
You fill my world with light.
Eyes, eyes, so deep and true,
I'm lost in love with you.

(Bridge)
Eyes, you can speak without words,
Your language, love, is pure and clear.
In your eyes, I see my destiny,
A future full of love and harmony.

(Chorus)
Eyes, eyes, so beautiful and bright,
You fill my world with light.
Eyes, eyes, so deep and true,
I'm lost in love with you.

(Outro)
Eyes, eyes, I love you so,
You're the light that guides me home.
