The image you sent me shows the cover of a comic book titled "Bound by Law? Tales from the Public Domain". The cover features a woman with a video camera and a Creative Commons shield, fighting off a cyclopean "Rights Monster". The text on the cover also includes the following:

* KEITH AOKI
* JAMES BOYLE
* JENNIFER JENKINS
* BOUND BY LAW?
* TRAPPED IN A STRUGGLE SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
* DUKE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
* BY DAY A FILMMAKER
* BY NIGHT SHE FOUGHT FOR FAIR USE!
* WWW.BOUNDBYLAW.COM

I am not familiar with this specific comic book, but it appears to be about copyright law and fair use. The comic book is available for free download on the Duke University School of Law website.
