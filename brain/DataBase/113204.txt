Here is a song on eyes:

(Verse 1)
Oh, your eyes, they shine so bright,
Like stars in the darkest night.
I could gaze into them all day,
And never get tired, no way.

(Chorus)
Eyes, eyes, windows to the soul,
They tell me stories, make me whole.
Eyes, eyes, I love your look,
You're the key to my heart's book.

(Verse 2)
Your eyes can be soft and kind,
Or wild and passionate, undefined.
But no matter what mood they're in,
I'm always drawn to them, my friend.

(Chorus)
Eyes, eyes, windows to the soul,
They tell me stories, make me whole.
Eyes, eyes, I love your look,
You're the key to my heart's book.

(Bridge)
When I look into your eyes,
I see the world in a new light.
I see your love, your joy, your pain,
And I know that I'm never alone again.

(Chorus)
Eyes, eyes, windows to the soul,
They tell me stories, make me whole.
Eyes, eyes, I love your look,
You're the key to my heart's book.

(Outro)
Oh, your eyes, I love your look,
You're the key to my heart's book.
Eyes, eyes, windows to the soul,
They tell me stories, make me whole.
