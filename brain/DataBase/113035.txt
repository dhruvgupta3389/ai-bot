I have executed the given code and the output is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a list of data
data = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
]

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["a", "b", "c"])

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

Output:

```
   a  b  c
0  1  2  3
1  4  5  6
2  7  8  9
```
