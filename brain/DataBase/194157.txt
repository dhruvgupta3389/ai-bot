Sure, here is a Python code to check if a number is even or odd:

```python
def even_odd(n):
  if n % 2 == 0:
    return "Even"
  else:
    return "Odd"

print(even_odd(10))
print(even_odd(11))
```

This code defines a function called `even_odd()` that takes an integer as input and returns `"Even"` if the number is even, or `"Odd"` if the number is odd. The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the number is divisible by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even. Otherwise, the number is odd.

The code then prints the results of calling the `even_odd()` function on the numbers 10 and 11. 10 is even, so the output of `even_odd(10)` is `"Even"`. 11 is odd, so the output of `even_odd(11)` is `"Odd"`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here are some other ways to write the code:

```python
def even_odd(n):
  return "Even" if n % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
```

```python
is_even = lambda n: n % 2 == 0

print(is_even(10))
print(is_even(11))
```

```python
# Using the ternary operator

print("Even" if 10 % 2 == 0 else "Odd")
print("Odd" if 11 % 2 == 0 else "Even")
```

Which way of writing the code is best depends on your personal preference and the context in which you are using the code.
